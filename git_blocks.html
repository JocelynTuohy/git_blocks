          <h2>What is Git?</h2>
          <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it
            as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code base. 
            With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whole
            application, seeing the growth of a full app. During
            this time you can make branches to experiment and come
            back to a previous snapshots you took or merge those
            experiments into your app.</p>
          <h2>What is GitHub?</h2>
          <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and
            collaboration. It lets you and other work together on projects
            from anywhere using those code snapshots that you took during
            development.</p>

            <h3>Git init</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git init</span> is the act of registering
            this current code base.</p>

          <div class="top">
            <h3>Git add</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git add</span> is how we stage the
            integration of our current code base into our current list of
            snapshots</p>

          <div class="top">
            <h3>Git status</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git status</span> allows us to see the
            changes we are going to make</p>

          <div class="mid">
            <h3>Git commit</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git commit</span>; finally we can commit
            those changes we added to our last snapshot giving us a new
            snapshot of our code with whatever new changes were made</p>

            <h3>Git remote add</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git remote add</span> is used to set up an
            online repository where we can place all of our current code. this
            is where the outside world can see our code base.</p>

            <h3>Git push</h3>
            <p><span class="command">Git push</span> is how we get our code to
            GitHub, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other
            developers might look at our existing projects to see how we
            approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or
            even update our code base with features they wanted to add</p>
